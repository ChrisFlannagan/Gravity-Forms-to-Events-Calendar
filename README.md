### PROOF OF CONCEPT ###

This is a proof of concept I've been dabbling with.  It's very sloppy and hacked on top of the gravity forms add on template they provide.

At some point, if I intend to use this for anything, I'll clean it up.  But it does work for mapping Gravity Forms fields to The Events Calendar posts, has a nifty little approval panel for submissions and role assignments for approved submitters.
